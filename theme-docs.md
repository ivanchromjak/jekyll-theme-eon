## Basic theme setup

### Site URL
The base hostname and protocol for your site. If you’re hosting with GitHub Pages this will be something like `url: "https://username.github.io"` or `url: "https://mydomain.com"` if you have a custom domain name.

```yaml
url:                    "https://eon.jekyll.plus"
```

### Site base URL
If you want to host your site in a subfolder (eg: /blog) set it as `baseurl: "/blog"`.


### Site and author details
Add your site and author details in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
title:                  Eon
description:            Multipurpose Jekyll theme.

# Default author settings
author:
  name:                 Pete Seth
  avatar:               avatar-tom.png
  title:                Support     
```

### Update favicon
You can find the current favicon (favicon.png) inside the theme `/uploads/` directory, just replace it with your new favicon.

### Update logo
The theme uses two logo files one dark for display on light backgrounds and one light logo for display on dark backgrounds. If you don't intend to use dark navigation backgrounds you don't need to upload the light logo.
Add your logo image files to `/uploads/` directory, then specify the logo files in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
logo:                   logo-dark.svg
logo_light:             logo-light.svg
```
If logo image files are not set, the site title text is displayed instead.

## Introduction to blocks

Theme uses blocks as source of content for many includes. Blocks is a Jekyll collection with its posts in `_blocks` directory. Some includes such as call to action will pull content only from one block post e.g.:
{% raw %}
```yml
{% include cta.html 
  block="cta-2"
%}
```
{% endraw %}
The above include references `cta-2` as block source, this displays contents of `_blocks/cta-2.md` file.

Other includes such as gallery, cards or sliders display contents of multiple block posts ordered by file name e.g.:
{% raw %}
```yml
{% include cards.html 
  block="feature" 
%}
```
{% endraw %}
The above include references `feature` as block source, this displays contents of all files that have `feature` as a part of their filename:
```yml
_blocks/
    feature-1.md
    feature-2.md
    feature-3.md
    feature-4.md
    feature-5.md
    feature-6.md
```
All the above files would display as cards (one file per card) ordered from 1 to 6.

## Blog
By default blog is displayed under `/blog/` permalink and blog page can be found in `/blog/index.html` location. Blog options can be modified in `_config.yml`:
```yml
paginate:           6               # Number of posts displayed on blog page
paginate_path:      "/blog/:num/"   # Blog path
```

### Creating your first post in Jekyll

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the `_posts` directory by following the recommended file naming format:
```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```
Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```

Post requires front matter, everything in between the first and second --- are part of the YAML Front Matter, and everything after the second --- will be rendered with Markdown and show up as “Content”.
The following is a post file with different configurations you can add as an example:

```yaml
---
title: How To Travel On Low Budget
---
```

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post. To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`. If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

## Translation

Set your language code in `_config.yml`:
```yml
lang: en
```
Theme strings can be translated in `_data/base/translation.yml`, copy the current English translation and paste it below the Eglish translation, then replace `en` with your language code that you set in `_config.yml` and translate the strings.

```yml
en:
  previous:                   "Previous"
  next:                       "Next"
